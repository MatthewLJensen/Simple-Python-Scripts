# Simple-Python-Scripts
 A collection of simple python scripts created for software design class in 2020. Adding them here for posterity.

## Coolest Scripts
* calendar.py. This script creates a visualization of any month of almost any year using Zeller's algorithm (as far as I can remember).
* word_search.py. This script takes in a list of words and hides them in a 2d array of other letters.
* numbers_to_words.py and words_from_number.py. Both of these are a pain to create. But they are rather nifty.
